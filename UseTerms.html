    <p>
      Terms of service (also known as terms of use and terms and conditions,
      commonly abbreviated as TOS or ToS, ToU or T&C) are the legal agreements
      between a service provider and a person who wants to use that service. The
      person must agree to abide by the terms of service in order to use the
      offered service.[1] Terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer,
      especially regarding the use of websites. Vague language and lengthy
      sentences used in the terms of use have brought concerns on customer
      privacy and raised public awareness in many ways.
